# Lua Math

This repository consists of coding examples and demos inspired by Keith Peters' [Coding Math](https://www.youtube.com/user/codingmath) YouTube videos.

While Keith's examples are done using the HTML5 `<canvas>` element and JavaScript, I'm re-creating them (to the best of my ability) using Lua and [LÖVE 2D](https://love2d.org/).

This is just to help myself learn Lua and math.
